# PLP Week 5 Python Programming Assignment
My name is Joseph Ajireloja.

This repository contains my answers to PLP Week 5 Python programming assignment.

# Questions
# (1): Design Your Own Class! 
- Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
- Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
- Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
- Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

# (2): Polymorphism Challenge!
Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving", while Plane.move() prints "Flying").
